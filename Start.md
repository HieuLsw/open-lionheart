This is the main page for the development of Open Lionheart. All the documentation should be here for other developers to use.

In order to execute the game you need:

-cocos2d: You can get the last version at http://www.cocos2d.org/. Execute this in console to get cocos2d to work with any project: **export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cocos**

-Pyglet API: In debian based distributions just type **apt-get install python-pyglet**. For windows systems you can download an installer here. http://www.pyglet.org/download.html

That's all :). Project should work by executing **python lionheart.py**
